There are 2 R files that can be run, namely "" and "". It is recommended to run "" first because it takes the shortest time to run.

For "", it contains all visualizations and results shown in the paper. It can be run in 1-go.

For "", it contains all the feature selections of the logistic regression model. It takes a very long time to run everything, i.e. almost 12 hours, so it is not recommended to run this file.

Note:

1. When installing new packages, if the command windows "restarting R session in prior" are shown, close all of them by clicking the top right cross button so that everything continues running.
2. Logistic regression on production system and PLSDA on all y variables generally take up longer running time, so it is not an error when the output does not change for a while for those models.
